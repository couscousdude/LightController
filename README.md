# LightController
Simple program written in WinForms and Dot Net that can trigger basic IFTTT webhooks in order to control lights/smartplugs/etc.

## instructions:
The program will launch minimized to the app tray. To configure, right click and the program will expand. Input your API url for IFTTT (the trigger is called "webhook") and save.
Minimizing the configuration window will minimize it to the app tray.
To quit the app, use task manager or just open the configuration window and close it instead of minimizing.
Left clicking the icon in the app tray will trigger the configured webhook.
